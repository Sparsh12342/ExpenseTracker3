# ExpenseTracker

ExpenseTracker is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and categorize financial transaction data using machine learning. The project focuses on transaction classification to help users better understand their spending habits.

## Features

- **Transaction Categorization**: Uses a machine learning model to classify transactions into categories based on descriptions.
- **Data Analysis**: Processes CSV files containing bank transaction data and generates categorized summaries.
- **Modular Python Code**: Includes scripts for data cleaning, feature extraction, and applying the ML model.

## Current Status

This project is in the early stages of development. It has the foundation for building a full-featured expense tracking application with intelligent transaction categorization.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning model)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Joblib (for saving/loading ML models)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
